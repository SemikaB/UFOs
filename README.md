# Project Overview

The purpose of his project is to help Dana build a webpage that displays information about UFO sightings with the use of JavaScript and an HTML index file. The webpage contains a list of UFO sightings with information around each sighting (date, city, state, country, shape, duration and comments). 
Our goal is to improve the webpage we built together which contained one filter that allows users to filter on up to all 5 pieces of information that we have for all sightings.

## Results

Upon opening the original page all unfilitered data will be displayed with the 5 filtered search bars ready for input.

Finally if added ontop of the "Enter Data" filter which was added 'f', it was seen that only 1 was filtered with the same date and state listed.

## Summary

After the filters have been added to the website, it allows users to easily analyze the data and get some insight around the topic of UFO sightings.

## Drawback
one drawback is that the dataset being used in not upto-date.

## Recommendation

One recommendation would be a feature to be enable seach and filter on key words, ideally in the comments as users may be looking for similar experiences they have heard of or had themselves.
